    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>
      It has become undeniably apparent that most of the media, especially social media has abandoned truth for power.
      Our mission is to create a social platform of honest, thoughtful dialogue. We believe free expression should not
      come at the cost of truth. That&apos;s why we have built our community guidelines and features around one core
      principle: safeguarding authenticity and we actively take measures to minimize the spread of misinformation.
